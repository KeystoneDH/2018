Please feel free to ask volunteers at the registration & information desk near the entrance for any information you might need. Or you can also tweet at us **@keystonedh** or email **contact@keystonedh.network**.

## Wifi?

CHF wireless ssid is `chf-conference-center` and the password is available at the registration & information desk.

## Social media?

Yes! **#keydh** / **@keystonedh**.

Please be mindful of attendees' wishes in posting images and, of course, giving credit where it is due. Presenters can help by being clear about how (or if) they would like to be re-presented.

## Where should I be?

Sessions will be held in the Ullyot Room of the Chemical Heritage Foundation near the entrance as well as upstairs, on the northwest corner of the second floor, in the Franklin Room. Accessible bathrooms are available on both floors.

Beverages and light snacks will be available in both Ullyot Rooms and on the second floor throughout the day.

## Session guidelines?

Links to collaborative notes (i.e., public Google Docs) appear above each session description in the [schedule]({{ '/schedule' | prepend: site.github.url }}).

Slides from presenters who would like to share will be available after the conference. 

We are committed to promoting a safe and inclusive conference environment. Please read our [code of conduct]({{ '/code' | prepend: site.github.url }}) and do let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
